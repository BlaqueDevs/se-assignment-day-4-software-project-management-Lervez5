II. Requires constant stakeholder involvement: Regular feedback and collaboration with stakeholders are essential, which can be time-consuming.
III. Less predictability: Agile’s iterative nature can sometimes lead to unclear timelines and budgets, making it harder to predict the final outcome.
IV. Requires experienced teams: The success of Agile heavily relies on the experience of the team and their ability to collaborate and adapt quickly.

II. Waterfall Methodology

1. Advantages of Waterfall:

I. Clear Structure: Waterfall’s sequential nature provides a clear, step-by-step plan with defined milestones, making it easy to understand and manage.
II. Predictability: With fixed requirements and deadlines, it is easier to estimate timelines, costs, and resources.
III. Detailed Documentation: Waterfall projects produce thorough documentation at each stage, ensuring clarity and a strong foundation for future phases.
IV. Ideal for well-defined projects: Works best when the project scope and requirements are clearly understood from the start and unlikely to change.

2. Disadvantages of Waterfall:

I. Inflexibility: Once a stage is completed, it’s difficult to go back and make changes, which can be problematic if requirements change during the project.
II. Late testing: Testing typically happens after development is complete, meaning issues or bugs might not be identified until the final stages.
III. Longer time to deliver: Waterfall often results in longer development cycles before anything is delivered to the customer.
IV. Risk of misalignment: If requirements are not thoroughly understood from the outset, there’s a risk that the final product may not meet user needs.



## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
**I. Projects where Agile might be more beneficial:**
